/// var listener = await Listener.bind(InternetAddress.anyIPv4, 8080);
/// print('Listening on ${listener.address.address}:${listener.port}');
///
/// while (true) {
///   var client = await listener.accept();
///   handleClient(client);

/// with `shared: true`. The OS distributes incoming connections across
/// isolates via `SO_REUSEADDR` / `SO_REUSEPORT`.

  /// the OS assigned.

  ///
  /// Blocks (asynchronously) until a client connects. The returned [Connection]
  /// inherits this listener's native port, so its completion messages are

  ///   unawaited(handleClient(connection));

  /// If [force] is `true`, all connections that were accepted from this
  /// listener and haven't been closed yet are closed concurrently after
  /// the listener socket is shut down. Any pending [accept] call completes
  /// with an error.
  ///
  /// If [force] is `false` (the default), only the listener socket itself
  /// is closed. Accepted connections remain alive and must be closed
  /// individually.

  ///
  /// If [port] is 0, the OS assigns an ephemeral port which can be read from

  ///
  /// If [v6Only] is `true` and [address] is IPv6, the socket only accepts IPv6
  /// connections (disables dual-stack).
  ///
  /// If [shared] is `true`, `SO_REUSEADDR` (and `SO_REUSEPORT` on platforms
  /// that support it) is set, allowing multiple isolates to bind to the same
  /// address and port for load distribution.
